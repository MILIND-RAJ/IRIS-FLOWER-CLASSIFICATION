# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
Created Machine Learning classification model using Scikit-Learn to predict whether an flower is Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. The model takes input four features the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
## Installation

We need numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn python libraries for creating and evaluating the model. We need to create Python 3 kernel in Jupyter Notebook

## Project Motivation
The project was created for the learning purpose i.e how to train and evaluate machine learning models.
Also the accuracy of two very famous machine learning models was evaluate namely Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree Classifier.

## File Descriptions

There is one Jupyter notebook available to show the code, used to train and evaluate the models.The notebook also shows the comparison of the two machine learning classification methods.

## Results
Both the models performed upto the mark and there is no large performance difference is seen between two models.
## Dataset
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

This dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines

#### Content
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species).
