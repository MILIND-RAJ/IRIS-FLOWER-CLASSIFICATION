# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
Created a Machine Learning model using Scikit-Learn to predict whether an image of concrete surface has a crack in it. The model is trained using existing deep learning models namely VGG16 and resnet50. Also the comparison based on the performance of these two models is made.
## Installation

We need numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras python libraries for creating and evaluating the model. We need to create Python 3 kernel in Jupyter Notebook

## Project Motivation
Compared the performance of two very famous deep learning classification models namely VGG16 and resnet50 

## File Descriptions

There is one Jupyter notebook available to show the code, used to train and evaluate the models . The notebook easily explains the above question.  

## Results
Both the models performed upto the mark and there is no large performance difference is seen between two models.


## Dataset
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

This dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines

Content
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species).
